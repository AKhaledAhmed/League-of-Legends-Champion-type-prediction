# League of Legends Champion Analysis

## Overview
Analyze a League of Legends dataset and applies machine learning models to predict champion types.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses champion data.
- Trains multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Installation
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook LOL.ipynb
  ```
- Run all cells to preprocess the data and train models.
- View model accuracy and predictions.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install them manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
