# League of Legends Champion Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a League of Legends dataset and applies machine learning models to predict champion types.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses champion data.
- Trains multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, classification reports, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   cd YOUR_REPO
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure you have the dataset (`LOL_champion_data.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook LOL.ipynb
  ```
- Run all cells to preprocess the data and train models.
- View model accuracy and predictions.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install them manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
